# VisuMath

I’m building this app to help myself learn multivariable calculus and vector functions, aligning with my current syllabus. My goal is to apply these concepts practically rather than just memorizing them, so I can truly understand what I’m learning and won't forget 'em since I'll prolly need it in future.

I’m also creating this app to learn some mathematics and  basic Blender, I plan to use Python for everything. The app will allow me to upload clips I create with Blender, as well as include a variety of questions.
