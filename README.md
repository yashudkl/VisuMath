I’m building this app to help myself learn multivariable calculus and vector functions, aligning with my current syllabus. My goal is to learn these concepts practically rather than the traditional way of learning just theoritical stuffs, memorizing them and giving exams. By this way I can truly understand what I’m learning , Know where these stuffs are actually being applied.
I’m also creating this app to learn basic Blender, I plan to use Python for everything. The app will allow me to upload clips I create with Blender, as well as include bunch of questions.
